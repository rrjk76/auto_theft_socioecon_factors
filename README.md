### Introduction
Auto theft is a prominent concern in urban environments, and the City of Toronto is no exception. Beyond being a property crime, auto theft is often intertwined with broader criminal activity, including organized crime, fraud, and illicit resale markets. For vehicle owners, the theft of a car can be more than just an inconvenience: it can disrupt their daily lives, limit access to work and essential services, and cause heavy financial strain due to insurance claims, replacement costs, and legal processes. From a more comprehensive perspective, high auto theft rates may indicate deeper socioeconomic issues, such as income inequality, unemployment, or systemic vulnerabilities within certain neighbourhoods. 

This study focuses on exploring the relationship between auto theft rates in Toronto neighbourhoods and various socioeconomic factors, seeking to understand the question: **Do certain socioeconomic conditions serve as indicators for higher rates of vehicle-related crime?**

Furthermore, this analysis explores which modelling approach, like decision trees, linear regression, or boosting methods (like GBM and XGBoost), best captures the relationship between socioeconomic conditions and auto theft rates, evaluating both classification and regression models for overall performance.
